# Manabi
A service for collecting topics to learn about. Hosted on [Github Pages](https://catsuko.github.io/manabi/), give it a go!

## Running with Docker

First build and run the containers via `docker-compose`:

```shell
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Once running, open the web app to use the service:

```shell
$ open http://localhost:4568
```
